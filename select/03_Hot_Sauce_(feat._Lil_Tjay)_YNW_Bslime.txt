(Dj Chose, P-Crisco)
Do it with no hands, ay
I'ma throw these bands
Hop out drop top, she gon' leave her mans
Put 'em in a casket, this drip gon' make him fall
We ballin' out, basket
My whole team gonna ball
I be drippin' like hot sauce, had to take the top off
All this Polo on me, I be playin' lacrosse
Haters looking dusty every time I come around
If they can't stand me, I'm sitting them down
(Dj Chose, P-Crisco) so many melodies
I'm worth so much, screamin' free Melly
I got the recipe, now they want my jelly
They say I'm up now, they keep on testing me
Hit the "Woah"
Where you got to go?
You said you want smoke, .223 came with that scope (yeah)
Sniper wipe your nose
Foreign coupe with a space ship, merry-go-round
You said you want smoke, with the gang we going we going rounds
She a dirty thot, yeah what you talkin' bout?
I said whoa baby, yeah you better chill out
Shawty like that, words so profane
Somethin' like a bad, girl want your love
Call me when you can
Do it with no hands, ay
I'ma throw these bands
Hop out drop top, she gon' leave her mans
Put 'em in a casket, this drip gon' make him fall
We ballin' out, basket
My whole team gonna ball
I be drippin' like hot sauce, had to take the top off
All this Polo on me, I be playin' lacrosse
Haters looking dusty every time I come around
If they can't stand me, I'm sitting them down
Do it with no hands, ay
I'ma throw these bands
Hop out drop top, she gon' leave her mans
Put 'em in a casket, this drip gon' make him fall
We ballin' out, basket
My whole team gonna ball
I be drippin' like hot sauce, had to take the top off
All this Polo on me, I be playin' lacrosse
Haters looking dusty every time I come around
If they can't stand me, I'm sitting them down
So many melodies
I'm worth so much, screamin' free Melly
I got the recipe, now they want my jelly
